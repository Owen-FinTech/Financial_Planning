# Financial Planning

This repo contains a Jupyter notebook file and supplementary files required to run it. The notebook file documents the use of APIs as part of the technical solution to create two financial analysis tools.

The first is a personal finance planner that allows users to visualize their savings composed by investments in shares and cryptocurrencies to assess if they have enough money in an emergency fund.

The second tool is a retirement planning tool that uses the Alpaca API to fetch historical closing prices for a retirement portfolio composed of stocks and bonds, then runs Monte Carlo simulations to project the portfolio performance at 30 years, 5 years and 10 years.
